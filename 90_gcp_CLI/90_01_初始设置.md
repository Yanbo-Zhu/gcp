Created a default .boto configuration file at [C:\Users\yzh\.boto]. See this file and
[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config] for more
information about configuring Google Cloud Storage.
The Google Cloud CLI is configured and ready to use!

* Commands that require authentication will use ybzhu910613@gmail.com by default
* Commands will reference project `itoperation-441318` by default
* Compute Engine commands will use region `europe-west4` by default
* Compute Engine commands will use zone `europe-west4-a` by default

Run `gcloud help config` to learn how to change individual settings

This gcloud configuration is called [default]. You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects.
Run `gcloud topic configurations` to learn more.

Some things to try next:

* Run `gcloud --help` to see the Cloud Platform services you can interact with. And run `gcloud help COMMAND` to get help on any gcloud command.
* Run `gcloud topic --help` to learn about advanced features of the CLI like arg files and output formatting
* Run `gcloud cheat-sheet` to see a roster of go-to `gcloud` commands.

# 2 更改配置 

1 
重新设置 compute/zone and region
`gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1`
`gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-c`


2 
更改project 
gcloud project list 看有哪些 project 
`gcloud config set project <project_ID>`

3 
更改使用的 google account 
gcloud auth list   看 gcloud 已经绑定了那些可用的 google account   
![](image/Pasted%20image%2020241110195953.png)

用 `gcloud auth login  <google_acount_email_addresse>` 去绑定新的 google cloud , 然后 gcloud auth list  就会多出来新的 account name 
![](image/Pasted%20image%2020241110200348.png)


重新设置新的 google account 作为默认的 account 
`gcloud config set account <google_acount_email_addresse>`
